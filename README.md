# DIY-face-masks (Work In Progress)

A selection of reusable face masks to make yourself easily. We don't want to make a single design or perfect design but we
want to provide a set of design depending of the capabilities of the user.

Homemade face mask are not to substitute to surgical, N95, FFP2/FFP3 masks, but they may help to prevent the propagation of a virus.

## Selection of raw materials/fabrics

The selection of raw materials can be performed based on the filtration efficiency and hydrophobic capabilities.

![Filtration Efficiency and Pressure Drop Across Materials Tested with Aerosols of Bacillus Atrophaeus and Bacteriophage MS2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adulau/DIY-face-masks/master/images/filtration-efficiency.png)

We read different papers (such as [Testing the Efficacy of Homemade Masks: Would They Protect in an Influenza Pandemic?](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Filtration-Efficiency-and-Pressure-Drop-Across-Materials-Tested-with-Aerosols-of-Bacillus_tbl1_258525804)) and we provide a table of the most efficient fabrics based on their filtering capabilities. The table might be updated based on
new references or scientific papers. If you want to reuse fabrics from old clothes, check the composition and take by priority fabrics listed higher in the table below. A lot of face mask
design allows to have different layers of fabric.

| Priority | Fabric type | Reason   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Non-recycled polyester fabrics    | Hydrophobic     |
| 2 | Recycled polyester fabrics | Hydrophobic (fiber less compact than virgin polyester) |
| 3 | Mixed/blend cotton - Poly Cotton | Partially hydrophobic |
| 4 | Acetate - 100% | Some good filtering capabilities but depending of the fabric quality |
| 5 | 100% cotton | Cheap and accessible but less efficient than the above listed |
| 10 | Silk | Not recommended (too thin at fiber level) but still better than nothing |

## How to use and clean your masks

- Do not touch the mask and its fasteners while you are wearing it.
- While fastening your mask, only touch the elastics or the borders.
- A mask must be specific to each person. Do not lend or exchange it.
- The mask must cover nose and mouth (respiratory tracts). 
- Wash at 60°C after each use.
- Dry the mask thoroughly including straps.
- Keep it in a dry place and not in contact with other clothes.

There are also alternative cleaning solution such as hydrogen peroxide but these solutions might not be accessible to everyone.

## TODO

- Printable version of patterns and instructions for diffusion to public in rural areas (feedback needed on specific awareness in such area)
- Make a list of tools needed for sewing masks
- Feedback based on tested masks and respirability capabilities
- Locally availability and supply of fabrics from around the world

## Designs

### Design 1 - mask with sewing at nose/center level - sewing pattern made from the hand

Original design of masks by [Julie Foucre](https://www.instagram.com/julie_jfo/). The video below describes all the steps to build your own masks with
you have some sewing experience and the required equipments.

The face mask uses rubber bands for hair.

### Design 3 - mask folded fabrics without sewing at nose/center level

Based on [DIY Covid-19 Fabric Mask (with Filter Pocket) Sewing Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9RWII2-5_4), simpler than the previous ones to make but also requires an iron to make the folds and pliers to hold folds during sewing. Cover the face well but go up too much on the nose and let air pass up at the level of the wings of the nose.
